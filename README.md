# Agora Android Voice Tutorial - 1to1

*其他语言版本： [简体中文](README.zh.md)*

The Agora Android Voice Tutorial for Swift 1to1 Sample App is an open-source demo that will help you get voice chat integrated directly into your Android applications using the Agora Voice SDK.

With this sample app, you can:

- Join / leave channel
- Mute / unmute audio
- Switch speaker

A full-fledged demo can be found here: [OpenVoiceCall-Android](https://github.com/AgoraIO/Basic-Audio-Call/tree/master/Group-Voice-Call/OpenVoiceCall-Android)

## Running the App
**First**, create a developer account at [Agora.io](https://dashboard.agora.io/signin/), and obtain an App ID. Update "app/src/main/res/values/strings.xml" with your App ID.

```
<string name="agora_app_id"><#YOUR APP ID#></string>
```

**Next**, integrate the Agora Voice SDK and there are two ways to integrate:

- The recommended way to integrate:

Add the address which can integrate the Agora Voice SDK automatically through JCenter in the property of the dependence of the "app/build.gradle":

```
implementation 'io.agora.rtc:voice-sdk:2.4.0'
```
(Adding the link address is the most important step if you want to integrate the Agora Video SDK in your own application.)
- Alternative way to integrate:

First, download the **Agora Voice SDK** from [Agora.io SDK](https://www.agora.io/en/download/). Unzip the downloaded SDK package and copy ***.jar** under **libs** to **app/libs**, **arm64-v8a**/**x86**/**armeabi-v7a** under **libs** to **app/src/main/jniLibs**.

Then, add the fllowing code in the property of the dependence of the "app/build.gradle":

```
compile fileTree(dir: 'libs', include: ['*.jar'])
```

**Finally**, open project with Android Studio, connect your Android device, build and run.

Or use `Gradle` to build and run.

## Developer Environment Requirements
- Android Studio 3.0 or above
- Real devices (Nexus 5X or other devices)
- Some simulators are function missing or have performance issue, so real device is the best choice
